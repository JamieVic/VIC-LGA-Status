# VIC-LGA-Status
## About the Project
The Victorian government have introduced a travel permit system to coincide with the COVID-19 situation in Australia. Basically, everyone entering Victoria must have a permit otherwise they cannot enter the state. Eligibility is determined on which local government area you're coming from.
Some people may find systems like this rather confusing because of social media and the news sometimes providing conflicting information. Others may even find government jargon outright confusing. This project aims to eliminate the confusing details and give you the information you need, which is if you're allowed to enter Victoria or not, and what you may need to do upon entry.
## How to Use
The program can be initialised in any Python interpreter. Enter the name of the LGA you're coming from into the input field and hit Enter. The program will use the data in the CSV file, provided by the Victorian government, to determine the permit status of that LGA.
